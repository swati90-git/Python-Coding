Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given  scores. 
Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.
Given list is [2,3,6,6,5] . The maximum score is 6, second maximum is 5. Hence, we print 5 as the runner-up score.


n = int(raw_input())
lst=list(map(int,raw_input().split()))
lst.sort(reverse=True)
i=0
while(lst[0]==lst[i]):
    i=i+1
print lst[i]
